# InfluxGrafanaTutorial
Example code for collecting weather data from an ESP32 and then uploading this data to InfluxDB in order to create a dashboard using Grafana.

The full tutorial and setup instructions are available on my blog - https://www.the-diy-life.com/grafana-weather-dashboard-using-influxdb-and-an-esp32-in-depth-tutorial/ or my Youtube channel - https://youtu.be/7M8MHa6W9w0

You'll need to add your own WiFi settings and InfluxDB connection details to the script before uploading it to your ESP32.
